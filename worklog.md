# Basic Functionality
Add location to places:
    Add geo library
    Install PostGIS
    Migrate to add address, coordinates fields

    When adding a place:
        User fills Address field
        Address is geocoded into GeoJSON
        Address, GeoJSON are saved into DB
        We could geocode every time on address..
